Description: lightweight DLNA/UPnP-AV server targeted at embedded systems
 MiniDLNA (aka ReadyDLNA) is server software with the aim of being                                                                                               
 fully compliant with DLNA/UPnP-AV clients.                                                                                                                      
 .                                                                                                                                                               
 The minidlna daemon serves media files (music, pictures, and video)                                                                                             
 to clients on your network.  Example clients include applications                                                                                               
 such as totem and xbmc, and devices such as portable media players,                                                                                             
 smartphones, and televisions.                                                                                                                                   
 .                                                                                                                                                               
 MiniDLNA is a simple, lightweight alternative to mediatomb, but has                                                                                             
 fewer features. It does not have a web interface for administration                                                                                             
 and must be configured by editing a text file.
