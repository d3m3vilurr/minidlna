# Usage: ./make_patches.sh ${upstream_branch} ${debian_branch}
#
#        This script should only be run if you cloned the git repository of the
#        minidlna debian package, and wish to generate the patches needed to
#        build the package. The patches are written to debian/patches/.
#
#        WARNING: The content of debian/patches/ will be removed by this
#        script, and replaced by the patches generated from the difference
#        between the upstream and the debian branches in the git repository.
#
#        If ${debian_branch} is not specified, it defaults to 'HEAD', and if
#        ${upstream_branch} is also missing, it defaults to 'dfsg'.
#        make_patches.sh can be run from anywhere within the git repository.
