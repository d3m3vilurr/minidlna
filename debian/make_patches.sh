# Usage: ./make_patches.sh ${upstream_branch} ${debian_branch}
#
#        This script should only be run if you cloned the git repository of the
#        minidlna debian package, and wish to generate the patches needed to
#        build the package. The patches are written to debian/patches/.
#
#        WARNING: Patches in debian/patches/ may be overwritten, if they happen
#        to have the same name as git-format-patch wants to use; patches that
#        do not follow git-format-patch's naming scheme are not deleted. The
#        debian/patches/series file is overwritten, and will contain the list
#        of generated patches.
#
#        If ${debian_branch} is not specified, it defaults to 'master', and if
#        ${upstream_branch} is also missing, it defaults to 'dfsg'.
#        make_patches.sh can be run from anywhere within the git repository.
